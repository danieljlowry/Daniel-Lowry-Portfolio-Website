# Hello ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my (Daniel J. Lowry) portfolio website.
Currently, this website is under construction, as I am currently learning the HTML/CSS/Javascript required to create the website. 
Once construction is finished, this section will be updated to summarize the website's design, functionality, and creation process.

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜ƒ
